# Delta Max Tests and Graphs
### Nearly linear AC discharging without input with a load of ~300W until battery is empty, after that linear charging like expected
#### Battery percentage goes down linear to 0.49%, there it stays for nearly 1 1/2 hour!
1) Battery percentage Delta Max, underneath output and input power, at 14:30 there was an connection error.

### Linear charging and discharging, then solar charging and at the end, battery recalibration.
#### Discharging shows nearly 1 hour 0.49 when output is linear, the same when linear charging, more than 1 hour at 99.49%, after solarcharging, battery recalibration, a percentage jump of 20%, ~400Wh.

### Percentage Jumps, with and without recalibration
#### Solar charging until 100% without output, the first jump from 94% to 99% did the device without our help. Then solarcharging and output. 2 recalibrations, one after running a washing machine, jump of 30% down, then solar charging, then recalibration, jump of 15% up.
